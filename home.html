          lifestyle. Being involved in physical activities on daily basis does
          something great to our body and mind. It makes us feel good, helps us
          to complete tough tasks, makes us pleasant all around and keeps us
          happy all time because our body releases a chemical called endorphins
          while we involved in the physical activities. Regular physical
          activities also reduces stress, improves sleep, boosts energy level,
          reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression, increases our self-esteem,
          makes us feel proud, improves confidence level and personality, etc.
